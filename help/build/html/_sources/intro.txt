Introduction
============
 
The idea of this QGIS plugin is to subsume different tools useful
during digitizing sessions. Everybody is welcome to add their tools
to this collection.

Currently the following tools are contained:

#.  SplitMultipart: Splits multipart features into singlepart in the
    active editable layer; taken from Alexandre Neto's SplitMultipart
    plugin.
#.  Cutter: cut out from active editable layer with selected polygon from
    another layer
#.  Splitter: split selected features in active editable layer with
    selected line from another layer

Planned/discussed tools can be found here http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/more-advanced-editing-tools-td5019552.html

This plugin is supposed to have no CAD-like tools which should go into
the CADTools plugin, see also http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/Make-QGIS-interact-with-LibreCAD-td5048565.html

Thanks to everybody joining the discussion and to Stefan Ziegler for
CADTools from where I took some code for the management of the plugin.
